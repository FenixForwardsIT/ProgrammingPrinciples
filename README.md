 DRY
--------
### as in Dont Repeat Yourself
To adhere to this principle means to avoid repetition by all means neccesary.

#### Why would you want to be DRY?
When you search for DRYness constantly you will have a compass that will guide you for better abstractions and composability.
You will end up with more functions that perform smaller tasks and at the end of the day you will have created a confortable bed to sleep on: A framework made by yourself, for yourself. That's the end goal.

Being _"all means neccesary"_:
- [Composability](https://fr.umio.us/the-philosophy-of-ramda/#composability)  (RamdaJS will help you achieve this!)
- Higher order functions

    To pass a function as a parameter means treating function as values. 
    Languages that support this are said to give function first class citizenry, because they treat them as values.
    Languages that support this are said to have first class functions.
  - Function as parameter
    To send a function as a parameter to another funtion allows you pivot easily.
    In Python this is called by the community as the Decorator Pattern, as it allows you to decorate a function. 

  - Function as return
    Now you have a function factory.
